_README editing_

This Manual Testing Challenge is my second course from DareIT. I've decided to participate in this one, feeling encouraged right after completing the Automated Testing and Python course, which I found really helpful and exciting. I'm sure this challenge will be also based on independent practice and that's exactly what I'm looking for. My main purpose for this course is to
- develop skills in *web and mobile app testing*
- understand the basics of *SQL* (which I've already started practicing on my own)

I also look forward to learn about *DevTools*, which, at this time, seem one of the most useful and practical testing tools to me.

### Subtask :four: ###
[Scouts Panel](https://scouts-test.futbolkolektyw.pl/en) - _exploratory testing_

Scouts Panel is a web application created for football ‚öΩ head hunters, so they could browse players' data. The structure and design of the app are simple and navigating seems to be intuitive. After logging in, user is redirected to the dashboard. The dashboard displays header, central area and left panel with 4 buttons (Main page, Players, Language change, Sign out). In the central area of the dashboard, there are 7 tiles, 4 of which are only text tiles and the other 3 are clickable. The first one redirects to contacting the Dev Team, the second one to adding a player form and the last one to the last created or updated player/match/report.
