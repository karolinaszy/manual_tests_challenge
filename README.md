This Manual Testing Challenge is my second course from <i>DareIT</i>. I've decided to participate in this one, feeling encouraged right after completing the Automated Testing and Python course, which I found helpful and exciting. I'm sure this challenge will be also based on independent practice and that's exactly what I'm looking for. My main purpose for this course is to: <br>
      
- develop skills in <b>web and mobile app testing</b> <br>
- understand the basics of <b>SQL </b> (which I've already started practicing on my own) <br>

I'm also looking forward to learning about <b>DevTools</b>.

<b> What's this app for? </b> <br>
Scouts Panel is a web and mobile application created for football ‚öΩ headhunters. It is a database with football players, matches and reports. <br>
<br>
<b> Functionalities: </b>

- login and password typing
- signing in
- signing out
- language change
- adding a new player/match/report
- editing existing player/match/report
- redirection to dashboard, players list, last created player/match, last updated player/match/report
- while displaying the players list: downloading CSV, printing the list, filtering the results, choosing of shown columns
- contacting the dev team

<b> Interface </b>
  
The interface is too simple and minimalistic, making the app look as if it's still being developed. 
After logging in, user is redirected to the dashboard. The dashboard displays header, central area and left panel with 4 buttons (Main page, Players, Language change, Sign out). In the central area of the dashboard, there are 7 tiles, 4 of which are only text tiles and the other 3 are clickable. The first one redirects to contacting the Dev Team, the second one to adding a player form and the last one to the last created or updated player/match/report. 

<b> Intuitiveness </b>

Only the dashboard seems intuitive to me. 
In my opinion, placing the picture with the logo on the left main panel would be more adequate.
